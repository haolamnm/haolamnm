<h2> ðŸŒŠ ABOUT ME </h2> 
Hello, I'm HÃ o LÃ¢m, an Information Technology student at VNUHCM-University of Science. The driving force in my journey into technology-the passion for continuous learning and the curiosity driving me through a wide range of interests: Computer Science, Computer Vision, Web Development, and Large Language Models. Each project I work on will be an opportunity to put new technologies into practice and further develop my skills. If youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss anything tech-related, please feel free to reach out!
